    "\n",
    "Your task is to use the feature-level method to combine the facial expression features and audio features. A multi-modal emotion recognition system is constructed to recognize happy versus sadness facial expressions (binary-class problem) by using a classifier training and testing structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original data is based on lab1 and lab2, from ten actors acting happy and sadness behaviors. \n",
    "* Task 1: Subspace-based feature fusion method: In this case, z-score normalization is utilized. Please read “Fusing Gabor and LBP feature sets for kernel-based face recognition” and learn how to use subspace-based feature fusion method for multi-modal system.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Task 2: Based on Task1, use Canonical Correlation Analysis to calculate the correlation coefficient of facial expression and audio features. Finally, use CCA to build a multi-modal emotion recognition system. The method is described in one conference paper “Feature fusion method based on canonical correlation analysis and handwritten character recognition”\n",
    "* Optional task: Use feature-level method (Task 2) on 10-fold cross-validation estimate of the emotion recognition system performance\n",
    "\n",
    "To produce emotion recognition case, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers are trained.  50 videos from 5 participants are used to train the emotion recognition, use spatiotemporal features. The rest of the data (50 videos) is used to evaluate the performances of the trained recognition systems."
